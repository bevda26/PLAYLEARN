# **App Name**: QuestLearn

## Core Features:

- Castle Interface: Display a 3D castle environment as the main interface for the platform.
- Dynamic Quest Cards: Generate and display 'quest cards' dynamically based on available educational modules.
- Auto-Integration Engine: Automatically detect and integrate new educational JavaScript modules into the platform.
- AI-Driven Quest Recommendations: When a module is ingested, use AI to determine appropriate quests for a player based on learning goals, mapping content such as desired outcomes with the learning content the JS module presents. Use this information as a tool when suggesting quest choices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#5534A5) to represent magic, royalty, and the immersive, fantastical elements of the learning environment.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222129), almost black, but visibly purplish -- allows the 3D elements and UI to stand out. Avoids eye strain in darker environments.
- Accent color: Golden Yellow (#FFC857) to highlight interactive elements, rewards, and areas of interest within the UI.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', sans-serif.
- Headlines: 'Playfair', a high contrast serif to convey elegance and high-end RPG fantasy.
- Use custom-designed icons with a medieval fantasy theme to represent different subjects, quests, and game elements.
- Incorporate magical effects such as floating particles, glows, and mystical animations to enhance the immersive experience.
